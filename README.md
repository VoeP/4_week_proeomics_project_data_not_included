# Backup of files concerning a 4 week project I did at a certain proteomics facility.
For legal reasons, I can't make the datasets used in this project public.
The idea was to develop a wrapper for various overrepresentation-analysis and gene set enrichment analysis tools as a R package.
While this idea didn't come to fruition due to time-limitations, it was an interesting project during which I learned a lot.
